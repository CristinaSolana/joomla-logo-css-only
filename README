Joomla!Â® Logo // CSS Only

Works great on Mac in Webkit browsers, haven't tested on PC.

Known issues:

It doesn't work in IE. I also have no interest in trying to make it work. 

Some browsers have an issue with the rotated child elements inside rotated parent element and therefore thin, white artifact lines are present. One I have a moment, I will actually take a different approach that doesn't require the rotated children inside a rotated parent.
